# About

[_DCMTK_](http://dcmtk.org/dcmtk.php.en) is a collection of libraries and applications implementing large parts the DICOM standard. It includes software for examining, constructing and converting DICOM image files, handling offline media, sending and receiving images over a network connection, as well as demonstrative image storage and worklist servers. DCMTK is is written in a mixture of ANSI C and C++. It comes in complete source code and is made available as "open source" software.

DCMTK is developed and maintained by the [Oldenburger OFFIS - Institut f√ºr Informatik (OFFIS - Institute for Information Technology)](https://www.offis.de/en.html) located in Oldenburg, Germany.

QIICR supported implementation of the new functionality into DCMTK, specifically, development of the following components:
* [dcmiod](http://support.dcmtk.org/docs/mod_dcmiod.html): a library for working with information objects and modules
* [dcmseg](http://support.dcmtk.org/docs/mod_dcmseg.html): a library for working with segmentation objects
* [dcmpmap](http://support.dcmtk.org/docs/mod_dcmpmap.html): a library for working with parametric map objects
* support of the DICOM TID 1500 family of templates to support structured reporting of image measurements within [dcmsr](http://support.dcmtk.org/docs/mod_dcmsr.html): a structured reporting library and utility apps
