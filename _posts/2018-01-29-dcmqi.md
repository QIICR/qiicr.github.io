# About

_dcmqi_ (DICOM for Quantitative Imaging) is a free, open source library that implements conversion between commonly used imaging research formats and the standard DICOM representation. _dcmqi_ can be used to create DICOM objects for storing voxelized image segmentations, parametric maps, and segmentation-based measurements. _dcmqi_ uses [_DCMTK_](http://dcmtk.org/dcmtk.php.en) classess and libraries that support the individual objects, and uses [_ITK_](https://itk.org/) to support research formats.

# Availability

**Installation**: We provide binary packages of _dcmqi_ for Windows, macOS and Linux. We also provide a Docker image of the library. _dcmqi_ can also be installed as an extension to _3D Slicer_ using _3D Slicer_ _Extension manager_. See installation instructions in the [user guide]](https://qiicr.gitbooks.io/dcmqi-guide) for details.
