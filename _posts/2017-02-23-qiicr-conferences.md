Continuing presence of QIICR at conferences and professional meetings is very important for us,
as it helps with disseminating the technology we develop and promoting the ideas we believe in.
Over the course of the past few years we became regular participants at the Radiological Society
of North America (RSNA) annual convention and NA-MIC Project weeks, and of course annual meetings
of the Informatics Technology for Cancer Research (ITCR) and Quantitative Imaging Network (QIN). 
We also presented at such venues as Cancer Informatics for Cancer Centers (CI4CC) in 2015 and 2016, 
and American Association of Cancer Research (AACR) in 2016.

This year we expand our outreach further with our participation in two more professional events.

On March 30, 2017, Andrey Fedorov will present at the [2017 AMIA Joint Summits on Translational Science][1].
In this podium presentation titled "Standardized communications of quantitative image analysis results 
using DICOM: Establishing interoperability through outreach and community engagement" we will summarize our
experience to date with conducting DICOM4QI connectathon at RSNA Quantitative Imaging Reading Room. The
presentation is scheduled at the session *S38: Translation in Clinical Practice* that will take place on
*March 30, 2017, from 10:30AM to 12:00PM*.

Later this year, in September, we plan to join the [Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Interventions
(MICCAI) annual meeting][2] in Quebec, Canada with a new MICCAI tutorial that was accepted for participation.
Our tutorial "21st Century DICOM for Quantitative Imaging Research: Why, What, and How" is co-organized by
Andrey Fedorov (Brigham and Women's Hospital) and Marco Nolden (German Cancer Research Center). In this tutorial
our goal is to encourage the MICCAI community to take a fresh look at the DICOM standard, and introduce some of the
new capabilities and tools we have been developing in the past few years. Our program includes talks by Ron Kikinis
and David Clunie, and plenty of time for hands-on with such open source software tools as the newly released [_dcmqi_ library][5],
[3D Slicer][3] and [MITK][4] that utilize _dcmqi_ to enable DICOM-based exchange of the quantitative image analysis results.

We look forward to meeting you at these and other events! If you want to connect and talk in person, send a message 
to Andrey Fedorov!
