In the coming week, many of the QIICR team members will be in Chicago to attend
Annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA). RSNA has long
been the main conference and annual milestone for our project. This year we again are
excited to share our progress and new developments, and meet new and existing users
of our tools!

Here are just some of the main updates QIICR will be show-casing at RSNA 2016.

## Quantitative Imaging Reading Room exhibit

We bring back our connectathon
that evaluates interoperability of imaging tools and workstations in exchanging
quantitative image analysis results using DICOM (DICOM4QI). We [initiated DICOM4QI
last year][1], focusing solely on standards-based communication of image segmentation results.

This year we expanded the scope of DICOM4QI to also evaluate interoperability of
communicating parametric maps, using DICOM Parametric Map objects, and quantitative
measurements, using DICOM Structured Reprting Template TID1500. We are also excited
to see a lot more (over 10) platforms evaluated in DICOM4QI!

For those of you who cannot be at RSNA, you can read the results in [this online gitbook][2].
If you are at RSNA, please stop by to learn more, to join DICOM4QI, or to learn more about
the capabilities of the standard, or any tools developed by our project.

Our "office hours" are as follows - stop by at any of these slots to meet someone from the team:

* 11/29/2016 - Tuesday - 12:15pm-1:15pm Central Time
* 11/30/2016 - Wednesday - 12:15pm-1:15pm Central Time
* 01/01/2016 - Thursday - 12:15pm-1:15pm Central Time

[Take a look at our poster][8], and if needed email [Andrey Fedorov][3] to schedule a meeting at
a convenient time, or ask any questons!

## *dcmqi* (DICOM for Quantitative Imaging)

In the past year, we put a lot of effort into generalizing DICOM conversion tools and
preparing [*dcmqi* (DICOM for Quantitative Imaging)][4]. *dcmqi* is a collection of libraries,
commmand line tools, web applications, and other goodies, that aim to help in converting
data stored using research formats into DICOM representation. At the moment, we have functional
tools that can be used to read and write DICOM Segmentation and Parametric Map objects, and convert
measurements into DICOM Structured Reporting documents that follow TID1500 reporting template.

Over the last month, *dcmqi* has been put to test as some of the participants of DICOM4QI use it
as part of their platforms to support DICOM interoperability. While we definitely have a lot of work to
do, we are happy with the current status of *dcmqi*. (N.B.: we are NOT happy with the current status of
  *dcmqi* documentation, but we will definitely improve it!)

# *Quantitative Reporting* extension of 3D Slicer

We have integrated *dcmqi* with 3D Slicer, our main platform for delivering end-user functionality.
To support end-user workflows, we have re-implemented from ground up the *Quantitative Reporting* extension
of [3D Slicer][9]. The updated extension now allows you to segment DICOM data, compute segmentation-based
measurements, save the results in DICOM and support loading of the measurements results stored using DICOM SR
back into Slicer. See the screenshot below for a snapshot of the user interface!

# New functionality in *DCMTK*

Michael Onken and JÃ¶rg Riesmeier led the development of new functionality in the [*DICOM Toolkit (DCMTK)*][10].
New this year are helper classes to support reading and writing of DICOM Parametric Maps, bug fixes to the support
of Segmentation objects, and [new classes for handling TID1500 structured reports][12]. All of those developments
are available in [the latest snapshot release of the toolkit][11], and are now integrated both with *3D Slicer* and *dcmqi*.

## PeerJ paper, PET analysis tools, and QIN-HEADNECK public dataset

This year we [published the paper][5] that summarizes a lot of our efforts in the past 2-3 years. At RSNA 2015
we shared a preprint of this paper, and now we are proud to report the work is completed and peer-reviewed
paper is published, accompanied by the open-source tools and [a publicly available dataset on TCIA][6]. The
quantitative analysis tools discussed in that paper are publicly available as 3D Slicer extensions - learn
more in the [videos prepared by the QIICR Iowa team][7].

## *SlicerPathology* and *SlicerOpenCV* extensions

Funded by an administrative supplement to the Brigham and Women`s Hospital and Stony
Brook University (led by Joel Saltz) ITCR teams, we have succeeded in integrating [*OpenCV*][13] library into
*3D Slicer*, and releasing *SlicerPathology* extension. This new extension is designed
to assist with the tasks of segmenting digital pathology images, and is integrated with
[*caMicroscope*][14] for convenient access to the data. *OpenCV* is a library aimed at real-time
computer vision processing, which is now easily accessible to all developers of *3D Slicer* extensions. 
We are grateful to the ITCR program for supporting this development!
