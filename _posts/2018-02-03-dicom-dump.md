# About

_dicom-dump_ is a package for the [Atom](https://atom.io) text editor tha provides a point-and-click interface for exploring the content of DICOM files. At the moment, the functionality provided is allowing to run DCMTK command-line tools dcmdump and dsrdump.

By using this Atom package instead of running the DCMTK tools in the command line, you can:

* conveniently copy content to the clipboard
* fold indented sections of the dump
* search for content of interest
