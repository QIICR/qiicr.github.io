# About

_PET-IndiC_ is an extension of 3D Slicer that implements calculation of the various quantitative measures given the SUV-corrected PET image series, and a segmented region of interest. The measures calculated by this module include the generic summary statistics measures, such as volume and mean SUV, but also the PET-specific items such as SUV Peak, Total Lesion Glycolysis (TLG) and Standardized Added Metabolic activity (SAM).

# Availability

**Installation**: _PET-IndiC_ can be installed as an extension to 3D Slicer via 3D Slicer _Extension manager_. In addition to the interactive module, the extension includes a command line interface module, _QuantitativeIndicesCLI_, which can be used in batch mode. The module also includes a plugin for 3D Slicer _Segment Statistics_ module that will be available automatically once the extension is installed.
