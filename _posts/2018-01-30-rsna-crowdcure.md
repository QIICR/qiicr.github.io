QIICR participated in the [Crowds Cure Cancer](http://rsnacrowdquant.cloudapp.net/) experiment at RSNA 2017.

The experiment pulled together researchers from a number of ITCR funded projects to build and test a 
system to have expert radiologists at the meeting provide annotation as input for further analysis.

The prototype system is available open source [on github](https://github.com/QTIM-Lab/rsnaCrowdQuant).  It is
a web application that communicates with a lightweight remote application server and database.

Over 250 people participated of whom 112 self-identified as radiologiests.  Together they provided
over 2000 annotations, with 3 participants providing over 100 annotations each and many others providing
more than 20.

A publication describing the work in more detail is planned.  For now contact Steve Pieper if you
would like additional information.
