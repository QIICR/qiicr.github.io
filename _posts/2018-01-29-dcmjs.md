# About

_dcmjs_ is a work in progress to support browser-based quantitative imaging workflows
that are interoperable with other DICOM compliant tools by reading and writing binary
([DICOM Part 10](http://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/pdf/part10.pdf)) objects.

A goal of _dcmjs_ is to make the use of DICOM object instances as convenient as possible for JavaScript developers
by mapping DICOM instances to JavaScript objects and the use of human readable dictiorary-based terms as member variables.

[This example](https://pieper.github.io/dcmjs/examples/qiicr/) demonstrates download and display of a [QIICR study](https://peerj.com/articles/2057/) head and neck PET and DICOM Segmentation Object downloaded on the fly from TCIA.  It first
downloads and parses the study then scrolls through the PET data showing the segmentation overlay.

# Availability

**Installation**: _dcmjs_ is available [on github](https://github.com/pieper/dcmjs).

Use in an html page with:

```
<script src="https://rawgit.com/pieper/dcmjs/master/build/dcmjs.js"></script>
```
a DCMJS object is exposed for use in browser scripts.

or install with npm:
```
npm install dcmjs
```



**Documentation**: Documentation is very sparse at the moment, but there are worked out examples for
manipulating studies, displaying/creating segmentations and structured reports.  Please contact Steve Pieper if you are interested in this prject.
