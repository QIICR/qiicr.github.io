One of the QIICR activities at the [RSNA 2015][6] was our first iteration of a "connectathon"
to demonstrate interoperability of image segmentation results between academic and
commercial platforms using DICOM. The scope of that activity is descibed in
[this poster][1], and has recently been highlighted in a [Kitware blog article][2].

The video above is a screen recording demonstrating the process of interchange of segmentation
results between [3D Slicer][5] (DICOM communication layer powered by [DCMTK][7]) 
and [Brainlab][3] PDM 2.2. David Flade from Brainlab and myself
worked on this video in the last days of RSNA, but only yesterday we finished resolving
all the administrative hurdles to make it publicly available. This video is also now
included in the [DICOM interoperability playlist of the 3D Slicer YouTube channel][4].
Many more educating and fun videos for
those interested in medical imaging, research and open source technology!

QIICR is open to collaborate with any commercial vendor in improving interoperability,
and refining the DICOM standard to support quantitative imaging biomarker development.
Please see [our RSNA poster][1] to access the test datasets and learn about the platforms
that we tested.

If you would like to join this connectathon activity next year with your
software, please get in touch with me. We will be very happy to highlight many more
successful examples of software integration, and improve interoperability across image
analysis packages, both academic and commercial!
